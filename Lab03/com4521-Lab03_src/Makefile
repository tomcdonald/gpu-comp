# NOTICE TO USER:
#
# This is an example Makefile for building a single source exercise from the lab 
# classes exercise in COM4521/COM6521 labs.
#
# This makefile is NOT for building the code on Windows. If you are using Visual 
# Studio then you will need to create a Visual Studio project as directed by the
# lectures/lab exercise. The makefile is for providing an additional build option
# for user familar with Linux.
#
# You may need to modify this makefile for building your own code or for building 
# and linking multiple source modules.
#
# Makefile only supported on Linux Platforms.

# Makefile variables 
# Add extra targets to OBJ with space separator e.g. If there is as source file random.c then add random.o to OBJ)
# Add any additional dependancies (header files) to DEPS. e.g. if there is aheader file random.h required by your source modules then add this to DEPS.
